I’m a software engineer with over 6 years of experience. I have worked extensively on banking and
finance domain. I mainly specialise in backend development using JVM languages like Java, Kotlin
and Spring framework. I'm currently working in a Fintech startup in Berlin focusing on payments
and banking. I have been involved in developing API based microservices and managing the complete workflow
from development to deployment.

I completed M.Sc in Computer Science from the TU Darmstadt, Germany where my specialization was focused on
distributed software systems. My master thesis was based on analyzing Big Data Benchmarks
for Apache Spark. Previously, I also worked as a software developer in Cognizant where I was involved in
developing risk management applications for payment gateway.

I’m interested in clean code, microservices and cloud solutions. I’m also enthusiastic about
learning new technologies and the best practices in the industry. Apart from technologies,
I’m an avid football fan and love travelling and photography.
